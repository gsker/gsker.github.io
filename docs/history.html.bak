      <h2>History of <em>Chapel Strings </em></h2><br />
            (An abbreviated version of the recollections of Jim Morin, one of the original members of <strong><em>Chapel Strings</em></strong>)
            <p><br />
  <em><strong>Chapel Strings </strong></em>has been in existence since 1960. The group's origins can be traced to a special Christmas presentation of the Gethsemane Lutheran Church choir during which they were accompanied by one string bass, a cello, a viola, and two first violins. After the performance, everyone was enthusiastic and considered the possibility of forming an organized string group that would play at various functions.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p> Shortly after this, Dale VanDuren, who was a member of Gethsemane and had organized the special Christmas musical presentation, had a vision, or an intense dream, about forming an orchestra. During the following months, he was successful in finding a director and enough musicians to form the group that eventually became <strong><em>Chapel Strings</em></strong>. <br />
  <br />
</p>
          <p>Throughout its history, <em><strong>Chapel Strings</strong></em> members have hailed from all parts of the Twin Cities and the suburbs, and from many walks of life - housewives, engineers, a violin maker, accountants, office supervisors, truckers, professional jazz musicians, and a dentist who also flew glider airplanes have all added to the musical mix at one time or another. Multiple generations have joined in - at one time <em><strong>Chapel Strings</strong></em> boasted a grandfather, his daughter, and granddaughter among its members. Currently, members range in age from college students to seniors in their 80s. <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>The orchestra generally performs in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. We continue to play in and around the Twin Cities each Monday evening, either at rehearsals or a scheduled performance. <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>The goal of <em><strong>Chapel Strings</strong></em> is to offer amateur musicians the opportunity to express their talents and abilities while simultaneously offering live music to enrich and enhance the lives of those in need, and to create a bond between performers and listeners that only music can offer. </p>
