    <div>Why do common midwestern folk, who you would think despise con-men and grifters, support  Trump?<br />I like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/w089qz/oc_trump_town_technically_boones_mill_va/igdcjis">/this description seen on reddit: </a><br/><blockquote text-align=center>
            <p>Their whole life they kept being told that society has no value for them. They bring nothing unique or innovative to the economy and their hatred, bigotry, and narcissism is held in contempt by decent people. Instead of self-reflection, they doubled down on the anger and bigotry but had to hide it because of all the "elite non-bigots" would "cancel them" if they revealed their true selves.</p>

            <p>Trump obviously made them feel accepted, justified their bigotry and hate, so of course they loved him for this. All their lives they were told they were wrong (because.....they were), so the moment someone, who appeared to be "of value" (a "billionaire" and celebrity), said they were right....well, they are never going back to feeling shame for being the disgusting people they are. "TRUMP OR DIE"</p>

            <p>These are not necessarily "stupid" people, but they are shallow and angry people incapable of self-reflection and therefore incapable of self-improvement. Calling this 25% of our society "deplorables" was a kindness.</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or my grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantative content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.</p>

<p>My grandmother had a very interesting theory; I said that we are all born
with a box of matches inside, but that we can not light them alone ... we
need the help of oxygen and a candle. In this case oxygen, for example,
would come from the breath of the person we love; The candle could be any
kind of food, music, caress, word or sound that generates the explosion that
will ignite one of the matches. For a moment, an intense emotion dazzles us.
A pleasant warmth grows inside us, fading away as time goes by, until a new
explosion comes to relive it. Each person has to discover what will trigger
those explosions in order to live, since the combustion that occurs when one
of the matches ignites is what nourishes the soul. That fire, in short, is
your food. If one does not find out in time what thing initiates those
explosions, the matchbox gets wet and not one of the matches will ever
ignite.</p>

Mi abuela tenía una teoría muy interesante; decía que todos nacemos con una
caja de fósforos adentro, pero que no podemos encenderlos solos...
necesitamos la ayuda del oxígeno y una vela. En este caso el oxígeno, por
ejemplo, vendría del aliento de la persona que amamos; la vela podría ser
cualquier tipo de comida, música, caricia, palabra o sonido que engendre la
explosión que encenderá uno de los fósforos. Por un momento, nos deslumbra
una emoción intensa. Una tibieza placentera crece dentro de nosotros,
desvaneciéndose a medida que pasa el tiempo, hasta que llega una nueva
explosión a revivirla. Cada persona tiene que descubrir qué disparará esas
explosiones para poder vivir, puesto que la combustión que ocurre cuando uno
de los fósforos se enciende es lo que nutre al alma. Ese fuego, en resumen,
es su alimento. Si uno no averigua a tiempo qué cosa inicia esas
explosiones, la caja de fósforos se humedece y ni uno solo de los fósforos
se encenderá nunca. </p>
